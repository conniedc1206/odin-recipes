# odin-recipes
My goal is to create a simple web page with my favorite Cantonese recipes that I grew up with. In order to do this, I will need to demonstrate the ability to use HTML elements, HTML tag, and HTML boilerplate. Additionally, I will demonstrate how to add text, images, links, and lists to the web page. I will also practice writing commit messages.
